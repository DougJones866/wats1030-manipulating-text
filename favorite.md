Since using the three different editors i've come to prefer emacs. Although initially it seemed a bit complex to use when you see things like C-x C-c, but it's actually really simple once you start playing around with it.
Maybe it's because it's the first one I used out of the three, but i've grown acustomed to it. it feels really quick to jump around files with it. plus it has tetris for thoes desperate times.
Compared to Vi, it feels more natural to use and feels a bit more feature rich than nano. Although I will still take the time to learn more about all three different editors so I can properly use each one if needed.
