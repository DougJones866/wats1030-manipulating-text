The Unix Philosophy
From The UNIX Programming Enviroment(1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike

Even though the UNIX system intruduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosphy can't be written down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. Manu UNIX programs do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools.
